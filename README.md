Integrating Notion calendars and Google Calendar

NOTE: This repo is currently a WIP as a personal project. I have no affiliation with any companies or software being used

TODO:
-Create logic for which cal events to grab
-clean datastreams so equivalent events look the same (ease of comparison)
-logic to compare event lists and figure out what needs to be updated in each calendar
-send updates to each calendar
-verify calendars are synced
